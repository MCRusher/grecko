The easiest way to use the grecko.jar is to store it in a folder alongside its .gk source files.
Then, execute it in a console.

In windows 7, shift+rmb gives the 'open command window here' option.
then, type 'java -jar grecko.jar' to execute the file.

It will prompt for source file name.
Enter the source you wish to run without the file extension.

if the source file is not in the same folder as grecko.jar, you will need to specify the full path of the file (still without extension),
otherwise just enter the name.

It should now output the results.
